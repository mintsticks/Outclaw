Hi! Welcome to my arcade! I'm Keiko.
Well...my owners arcade, but I basically run the place!
What can I help ya with?
    -> My owner went missing, but he left behind this key,
    > Akio told me that you might know about it?
        *growls* Not those guys again.
        -> What guys?
            The Yakuza. That stupid gang.
            They run the whole city. My owner used to be one.
            They still come by sometime. Those thieves,
            I oughta scratch their eyes out, every last one of them!
            -> Do you think they have my owner?
                I can't be sure, but I can tell you where to find out!
                Go to the tattoo shop. It's their main base.
                If they got him, he's there.
                -> Thanks Keiko!
                    Scratch em up a bit for me!
