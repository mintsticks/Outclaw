Did you find it?
-> I think so, is this yours?
    Yes. I assume you have some questions.
    Ask away, but don't think this means I like you.
    -> I'll take it!
      -> Were you always a stray?
          No, I used to have an owner, like you.
          Until he abandoned me in that park.
          Now I'm just a stray like every other cat in this city.
          -> ...I'm sorry, Akio, maybe-
              Don't start, kid.
              I'm better off this way.
                  -> What do you know about this key?
                      Unfortunately for you, not much.
                      I just know that mark is bad news.
                      If your owner was mixed up with that...
                      he's never coming home.

Anything else?
-> What should I do now?
    If you really wanna know more, go to the arcade and talk to Keiko.
    He'll know more about that key.
    -> Thanks Akio.
        Be careful, kid.
