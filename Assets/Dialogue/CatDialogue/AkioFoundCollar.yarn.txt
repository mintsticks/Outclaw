Did you find it?
-> I think so, is this yours?
    Yes. I assume you have some questions.
    Ask away, but don't think this means I like you.
    I still think you're an idiot.
    -> I'll take it!
        -> Were you always a stray?
            No, I used to have an owner, like you.
            We went to that park all the time.
            We went there one day, sat down at a bench,
            then he just left me there. I didn't believe it.
            I went back home and everything was gone.
            Oh well, it's better this way. 
            -> ...I'm so sorry, Akio, maybe-
                Don't start kid.
                -> What do you know about this key?
                    Unfortunately for you, not much.
                    I just know that mark is bad news.
                    It's some kind of gang symbol.
                    If your owner was mixed up with them,
                    he's never coming home.

Anything else?
-> What should I do now?
    You should quit. Before you get hurt. 
    But if you're really so dead set on this, 
    Go to the arcade in the city, talk to Denni.
    She'll know more about the gang. 
    -> Thanks Akio. 
        Be careful, kid.
