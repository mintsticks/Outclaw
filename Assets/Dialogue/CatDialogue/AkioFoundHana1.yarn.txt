What do you want?
-> I'm [$name], Hana told me you could help. 
    Of course she did. 
    Sorry kid, but you're out of luck.
                -> My owner is missing. I'm trying to find him. 
        We're all missing owners. 
        No one ever finds them. 
        Give up while you can. 
        -> Can you just look at this key? I found it in my owner's room.
            That key...looks like...
            Listen, if you want my help, I'm gonna need something from you first. 
            -> What?
                I left something in the park a while back. 
                I need you to get it for me. 
                -> Why do you need me?
                    The park is littered with guards now.
                    I haven't been able to get past em' yet.
                    You're small, and you'll blend into the shadows.
                    I'm sure you could make it. 
                    -> What am I supposed to find?
                        Don't worry about it; you'll know. 
                        Now, get on with it. 
                        -> Got it, Akio, see you later!
Can't wait..
